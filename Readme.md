Additional Work Experience

Volunteer Student Program Director at Casa De Manana  {#volunteer-student-program-director-at-casa-de-manana .list-paragraph}
----------------------------------------------------

This multi-generational club allows for UC San Diego undergraduates and
residents from retirement communities, to connect in conversations to
learn more about each generation. Both students and residents find
commonalities and differences within their generations, which provide
different perspectives on life. These human interactions transform our
learning process and these relationships encourage a more interconnected
learning approach based on our own narratives, a powerful and daunting
way to navigate our formal education at UC San Diego. But most
importantly, the club provides a more in-depth understanding of our own
life journey as we move on from one decade to the next.
